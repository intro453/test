# Introduction

While Laravel does not dictate which JavaScript or CSS pre-processors you use, it does provide a basic starting point using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and / or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) that will be helpful for many applications. By default, Laravel uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install both of these frontend packages.

> This legacy package is a very simple authentication scaffolding built on the Bootstrap CSS framework.  
> While it continues to work with the latest version of Laravel, you should consider using [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze) for new projects.  
> Or, for something more robust, consider [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/).
